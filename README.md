- 👋 Hi, I’m @CIT-Mech-Anand
👀 I’m interested in sustainable technology, mechanical design, and optimizing engineering systems for efficiency. My key projects focus on atmospheric water generation, CFD simulations, and waste management solutions.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), heat recovery systems, and mechanical design optimization. I’m also exploring the use of solar energy in water generation systems and improving mechanical waste baling technology.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative water generation technologies, energy-efficient systems, and mechanical design challenges. I’m open to working on projects that leverage simulation, automation, and eco-friendly technologies.

📫 How to reach me: You can reach me through [your email] or connect with me via GitHub.

⚡ Fun fact: I’m working on a system that condenses water from the air using heat recovery and solar power, aiming to provide a sustainable water source even in dry climates!
